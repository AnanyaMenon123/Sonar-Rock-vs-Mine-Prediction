# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

The objective of this project is to detect if the object that a ship/a submarine detects using sonar technology below it when it is above or under water is a rock or a mine.
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle contains columns that has different angles and the data values are different energy levels associated with a certain frequency after transmission of signal from the ship/submarine that lie between 0.1 to 0.10. Every observation has frequencies after transmission at different angles.
We have used a Logistic Regression model, that detects the predicted values with 76% accuracy.
Predicted values are compared with the actual values and a confusion matrix is plotted that gives you True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative
